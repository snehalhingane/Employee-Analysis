# Employee-Analysis using R language

  Nowadays, data mining is playing a vital role in Business and industries one of the most important areas of research with the objective of finding meaningful information from the data stored in huge dataset. Data Mining or knowledge discovery has become the area of growing significance because it helps in analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information.
  In this project different techniques are used for the Employee’s salary analysis and their performance is compared in order to evaluate the best model.
  We have used dataset as "Emp.csv" file,In that we have done data exploration by using Boxplot,Barplot,piechart,Histogram to visualize large dataset into easiest way and make it easy to fetch the data as soon as possible.
  Experimental results shows that the Naive Bayes is a better algorithm for the prediction of employee salary analysis for the values of accuracy the models.Also we use the classification for better result of employee’s salary prediction according to their joining date. The confusion matrix shows the prediction of salary by categorizing the dataset into two parts (Yes, No). This study can help in making more effective and reliable analysis and more efficient to use the system which will contribute towards developing and improving the business by reducing overall cost, time and mortality rate.
